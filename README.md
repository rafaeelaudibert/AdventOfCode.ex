# Advent of Elixir

Repository containing the working in progress solutions for 2020 AOC in Elixir.

 > Disclaimer: I'm a totally beginner in Elixir, and you can be totally sure that every code contained in this repository isn't the right way to solve the problems in Elixir.

## Usage

You can run the tests with `mix test`.

If you want to run only a part of a given day individually, you can use the available `mix` tasks. For example, `mix d01.p1` to run the part1 for day 1. You can also pass an extra `-b` flag, to run a benchmark.
